	1. DEFINITIONS

	A. "Contributor" means Government Agency, as the developer of the
	Original Software, and any entity that makes a Modification.
	B. "Covered Patents" mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor
	that are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Modification
	alone or when combined with the Subject Software.
	C. "Display" means the showing of a copy of the Subject Software,
	either directly or by means of an image, or any other device.
	D. "Distribution" means conveyance or transfer of the Subject

	deletion from, the substance or structure of either the Original
	Software or Subject Software, and includes derivative works, as that
	term is defined in the Copyright Statute, 17 USC 101.  However, the
	act of including Subject Software as part of a Larger Work does not in
	and of itself constitute a Modification.
	G. "Original Software" means the computer software first released
	under this Agreement by Government Agency with Government Agency
	designation ______________ and entitled
	_____________________________________________, including source code,
	object code and accompanying documentation, if any.

	for any purpose.

	2. GRANT OF RIGHTS

	A. Under Non-Patent Rights: Subject to the terms and conditions of
	this Agreement, each Contributor, with respect to its own contribution
	to the Subject Software, hereby grants to each Recipient a
	non-exclusive, world-wide, royalty-free license to engage in the
	following activities pertaining to the Subject Software:

	1. Use
	2. Distribution
	3. Reproduction
	4. Modification
	5. Redistribution
	6. Display

	B. Under Patent Rights: Subject to the terms and conditions of this
	Agreement, each Contributor, with respect to its own contribution to
	the Subject Software, hereby grants to each Recipient under Covered
	Patents a non-exclusive, world-wide, royalty-free license to engage in
	the following activities pertaining to the Subject Software:

	1. Use
	2. Distribution
	3. Reproduction
	4. Sale
	5. Offer for Sale

	C. The rights granted under Paragraph B. also apply to the combination
	of a Contributor's Modification and the Subject Software if, at the
	time the Modification is added by the Contributor, the addition of
	such Modification causes the combination to be covered by the Covered
	Patents.  It does not apply to any other combinations that include a
	Modification.

	D. The rights granted in Paragraphs A. and B. allow the Recipient to
	sublicense those same rights.  Such sublicense must be under the same
	terms and conditions of this Agreement.

	3. OBLIGATIONS OF RECIPIENT

	A. Distribution or Redistribution of the Subject Software must be made
	under this Agreement except for additions covered under paragraph 3H.

	1. Whenever a Recipient distributes or redistributes the Subject
	Software, a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy
	of the Subject Software; and
	2. If Recipient distributes or redistributes the Subject Software in
	any form other than source code, Recipient must also make the
	source code freely available, and must provide with each copy of
	the Subject Software information on how to obtain the source code
	in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used for
	software exchange.

	B. Each Recipient must ensure that the following copyright notice
	appears prominently in the Subject Software:

	[Government Agency will insert the applicable copyright notice in each
	agreement accompanying the initial distribution of original software
	and remove this bracketed language.]

	[The following copyright notice will be used if created by a
	contractor pursuant to Government Agency contract and rights obtained
	from creator by assignment.  Government Agency will insert the year
	and its Agency designation and remove the bracketed language.]
	Copyright  {YEAR} United States Government as represented by ______
	_________________________.  All Rights Reserved.

	[The following copyright notice will be used if created by civil
	servants only. Government Agency will insert the year and its Agency
	designation and remove the bracketed language.]  Copyright � {YEAR}
	United States Government as represented by _____________
	_____________________________.  No copyright is claimed in the United
	States under Title 17, U.S.Code. All Other Rights Reserved.

	C. Each Contributor must characterize its alteration of the Subject
	Software as a Modification and must identify itself as the originator
	of its Modification in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent
	Recipients to identify the originator of the Modification.  In
	fulfillment of these requirements, Contributor must include a file
	(e.g., a change log file) that describes the alterations made and the
	date of the alterations, identifies Contributor as originator of the
	alterations, and consents to characterization of the alterations as a
	Modification, for example, by including a statement that the
	Modification is derived, directly or indirectly, from Original
	Software provided by Government Agency. Once consent is granted, it
	may not thereafter be revoked.

	D. A Contributor may add its own copyright notice to the Subject
	Software.  Once a copyright notice has been added to the Subject
	Software, a Recipient may not remove it without the express permission
	of the Contributor who added the notice.

	E. A Recipient may not make any representation in the Subject Software
	or in any promotional, advertising or other material that may be
	construed as an endorsement by Government Agency or by any prior
	Recipient of any product or service provided by Recipient, or that may
	seek to obtain commercial advantage by the fact of Government Agency's
	or a prior Recipient's participation in this Agreement.

	F. In an effort to track usage and maintain accurate records of the
	Subject Software, each Recipient, upon receipt of the Subject
	Software, is requested to register with Government Agency by visiting
	the following website: ______________________________.  Recipient's
	name and personal information shall be used for statistical purposes
	only. Once a Recipient makes a Modification available, it is requested
	that the Recipient inform Government Agency at the web site provided
	above how to access the Modification.

	[Alternative paragraph for use when a web site for release and
	monitoring of subject software will not be supported by releasing
	Government Agency] In an effort to track usage and maintain accurate
	records of the Subject Software, each Recipient, upon receipt of the
	Subject Software, is requested to provide Government Agency, by e-mail
	to the Government Agency Point of Contact listed in clause 5.F., the
	following information: ______________________________.  Recipient's
	name and personal information shall be used for statistical purposes
	only. Once a Recipient makes a Modification available, it is requested
	that the Recipient inform Government Agency, by e-mail to the
	Government Agency Point of Contact listed in clause 5.F., how to
	access the Modification.

	G. Each Contributor represents that that its Modification is believed
	to be Contributor's original creation and does not violate any
	existing agreements, regulations, statutes or rules, and further that
	Contributor has sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by this
	Agreement.

	H. A Recipient may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty,
	support, indemnity and/or liability obligations to one or more other
	Recipients of the Subject Software.  A Recipient may do so, however,
	only on its own behalf and not on behalf of Government Agency or any
	other Recipient.  Such a Recipient must make it absolutely clear that
	any such warranty, support, indemnity and/or liability obligation is
	offered by that Recipient alone.  Further, such Recipient agrees to
	indemnify Government Agency and every other Recipient for any
	liability incurred by them as a result of warranty, support, indemnity
	and/or liability offered by such Recipient.

	I. A Recipient may create a Larger Work by combining Subject Software
	with separate software not governed by the terms of this agreement and
	distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In such case, the
	Recipient must make sure Subject Software, or portions thereof,
	included in the Larger Work is subject to this Agreement.

	J. Notwithstanding any provisions contained herein, Recipient is
	hereby put on notice that export of any goods or technical data from
	the United States may require some form of export license from the
	U.S. Government.  Failure to obtain necessary export licenses may
	result in criminal liability under U.S. laws.  Government Agency
	neither represents that a license shall not be required nor that, if
	required, it shall be issued.  Nothing granted herein provides any
	such export license.

	4. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES AND LIABILITIES; WAIVER AND INDEMNIFICATION

	A. No Warranty: THE SUBJECT SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" WITHOUT ANY
	WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED, IMPLIED, OR STATUTORY,
	INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, ANY WARRANTY THAT THE SUBJECT SOFTWARE
	WILL CONFORM TO SPECIFICATIONS, ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
	MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR FREEDOM FROM
	INFRINGEMENT, ANY WARRANTY THAT THE SUBJECT SOFTWARE WILL BE ERROR
	FREE, OR ANY WARRANTY THAT DOCUMENTATION, IF PROVIDED, WILL CONFORM TO
	THE SUBJECT SOFTWARE. THIS AGREEMENT DOES NOT, IN ANY MANNER,
	CONSTITUTE AN ENDORSEMENT BY GOVERNMENT AGENCY OR ANY PRIOR RECIPIENT
	OF ANY RESULTS, RESULTING DESIGNS, HARDWARE, SOFTWARE PRODUCTS OR ANY
	OTHER APPLICATIONS RESULTING FROM USE OF THE SUBJECT SOFTWARE.
	FURTHER, GOVERNMENT AGENCY DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES AND LIABILITIES
	REGARDING THIRD-PARTY SOFTWARE, IF PRESENT IN THE ORIGINAL SOFTWARE,
	AND DISTRIBUTES IT "AS IS."

	B. Waiver and Indemnity: RECIPIENT AGREES TO WAIVE ANY AND ALL CLAIMS
	AGAINST THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT, ITS CONTRACTORS AND
	SUBCONTRACTORS, AS WELL AS ANY PRIOR RECIPIENT.  IF RECIPIENT'S USE OF
	THE SUBJECT SOFTWARE RESULTS IN ANY LIABILITIES, DEMANDS, DAMAGES,
	EXPENSES OR LOSSES ARISING FROM SUCH USE, INCLUDING ANY DAMAGES FROM
	PRODUCTS BASED ON, OR RESULTING FROM, RECIPIENT'S USE OF THE SUBJECT
	SOFTWARE, RECIPIENT SHALL INDEMNIFY AND HOLD HARMLESS THE UNITED
	STATES GOVERNMENT, ITS CONTRACTORS AND SUBCONTRACTORS, AS WELL AS ANY
	PRIOR RECIPIENT, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW.  RECIPIENT'S SOLE
	REMEDY FOR ANY SUCH MATTER SHALL BE THE IMMEDIATE, UNILATERAL
	TERMINATION OF THIS AGREEMENT.


	5. GENERAL TERMS

	A. Termination: This Agreement and the rights granted hereunder will
	terminate automatically if a Recipient fails to comply with these
	terms and conditions, and fails to cure such noncompliance within
	thirty (30) days of becoming aware of such noncompliance.  Upon
	termination, a Recipient agrees to immediately cease use and
	distribution of the Subject Software.  All sublicenses to the Subject
	Software properly granted by the breaching Recipient shall survive any
	such termination of this Agreement.

	B. Severability: If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or
	unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity
	or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this Agreement.

	C. Applicable Law: This Agreement shall be subject to United States
	federal law only for all purposes, including, but not limited to,
	determining the validity of this Agreement, the meaning of its
